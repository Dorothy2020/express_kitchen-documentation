**Express kitchen**
We are working on a web_app application system whose main objective is to track and monitor stock to avoid over budgeting.

Product documentation
User documentation
We are  creating  for the product user
Two types of user documentation
System administrators help us to provide information about how the system would operate the software. 
End-users-the web_app application that we are creating help our user to solve the problem of over budgeting
Functional description – we are using the functional description that would help us to describe the functionalities of the product.
System admin guide – we have a system admin guide that helps us to explain different types of roles in the system in a different environment. It also helps us to provide instructions on how to deal with malfunction situations.




System Documentation
We are using system documentation so that it provides us an overview of the system to understand the underlying technology  while developing the system.
It usually consists of :
The requirements document
Architecture design
 Source code
 Validation docs
Verification 
Testing info
 Maintenance or help guide. 



Process documentation- It will cover all activities surrounding our product development.The  value of keeping the documentation will help us to make development more organized and well planned. It will require some planning and paperwork during the development.

We are using process documentation in our project because it guides us from the start of the project until the end of it. It outlines the exact steps needed to complete a task or the process from the start to finish.
